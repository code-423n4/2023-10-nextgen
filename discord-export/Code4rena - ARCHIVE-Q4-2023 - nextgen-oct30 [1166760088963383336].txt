hey, why 14 days for 918 SLOC ?


[10/27/2023 12:08] piravlos
actual its a bit more than 918 but it does not really matter 🙂 there are many contracts that interact between each other as well as 3 different randomizer contracts so its a bit complex, that's why the timeperiod is a bit long. I am 100% sure that you will find this project really interesting 🙂

not sure what's this error, what are you trying to do?


[10/30/2023 20:08] al_qa_qa
Hardhat project, no fuzzing, simple test file, alot of sol files not arranged, no interfaces, not previously audited.

I can smell at least +5highs

[10/30/2023 20:09] al_qa_qa

The error message is happens because of a package called `@scure/bip39`. You can remove the package declaration in the package-lock.json, but I don't know if this will make errors.

removing the package declaration works for instalation, lets see if it doesn't break something else


[10/30/2023 20:28] al_qa_qa
Great, I think this package is used for encrypting.

If some scripts relying on it the error will occurs, but with a message of not existed package. If it is not used, then its fine, everything should work correctly.

Hi everyone,
sorry to bother with that kind of issue but i cannot run `npm i` as i get this error : 

npm ERR! command failed
npm ERR! command sh -c node-gyp-build
npm ERR! sh: node-gyp-build: command not found

It seems to be related to classic-level node-modules. Did anyone encounter this issue?

I have python installed, node-gyp and Xcode.
I have no issue with creating a new hardhat project, with classic-level module correctly installed. I also have no issue with npm init other hardhat repos


[10/31/2023 03:00] 0xhegel
Are the files in the directory 'hardhart/smart-contracts' and the directory 'smart-contracts' the same?
@piravlos @prxt


[10/31/2023 03:12] tadev0
Ok now i'm good, just deleting the package-lock.json file before npm install resolved the issue.

weirdly, as there is no modification in the new package-lock.json, especially in the classic-level node module

the deployed contracts on testnet are the same as the ones that exist in the smart-contracts folder within github. If you would like to use foundry it's not a problem.

Hi auditors and devs,

I found that smart contract architecture is not the best, so I managed to refactor it and make it better.

I made refactoring to smart contracts and added some functionality like (static analysis) and professional gas reporting in the new codebase. You can check it out in my GitHub repo.

Should we audit this repo or only for analysis?


[10/31/2023 13:07] aba1842
you will always need to audit only the repo indicated by C4, each can modify/change whatever they want locally but when submitting issues you are obligated to refer them to the original repo and no other (invalid otherwise). So no, not this one. The official one only: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen

That above one was just a warden's reordering of code so it would be better suited to his needs. Nothing more, nothing less


[10/31/2023 13:10] .akira0327
Thanks.
Should I use git diff cmd to commit test code when submitting issues or it will be ignored(i.e. I included test code block in submission template directly)?


[10/31/2023 13:12] aba1842
both are valid and accepted by judges. I sometimes use `git diff` for tests, but mostly for fix suggestions. For tests I just add the code in a code block. Like I said, both are fine, choose the one you like more

Is `NextGenCore` contract will be deployed once and artists will create a collection on top of it? Or this contract will be deployed by any company that needs multiple collections of NFTs and Royalties, in order for these companies to have access to the functions? @piravlos


[10/31/2023 15:47] al_qa_qa
DM'ed @piravlos


[10/31/2023 15:57] piravlos
It will be deployed once and then collections will be created by many artists on top of it.


[10/31/2023 16:05] zdravkohr
And these artists should be authorized by the protocol?


[10/31/2023 16:13] aba1842
I think I saw, coincidently, last week a tweet about this used on another project. From what I've heard, Balancer also uses something similar (user - action - selector access control). Can't find the tweet though 😦


[10/31/2023 16:13] dimulski
@piravlos , @prxt sent FR


[10/31/2023 16:27] 6529
i think it is both tbh.

1) we will run a series of collections at 6529.  In that case, we will deploy the contracts and select the artists and once we create a new collection for a specific artist, we will give them the relevant access rights to that collection
2) if a different organization wants to make their own series of collection (e..g. the University of Nicosia will do their certificates using NextGen, they will deploy the contracts themselves).  in other words the generative art of the memes and the unic certificates won't be separate collections on one contract deployment

[11/01/2023 08:22] 6529
Mintpasses in the world of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a relatively recent innovation designed to improve the process of minting NFTs. Here’s a breakdown of the concept:

### What is an NFT?

An NFT is a type of digital asset that represents ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content, such as artwork, music, videos, or collectibles, using blockchain technology. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, each NFT has a unique identifier that makes it distinct and not interchangeable.

### What is Minting?

Minting is the process of creating a new NFT. It involves recording the data on a blockchain, which turns a digital file into a crypto collectible or digital asset. This process usually requires the creator to pay a fee (often in cryptocurrency) to compensate for the energy and computing power used to process the transaction and add it to the blockchain.

### What are Mintpasses?

A mintpass is a special type of NFT that gives its holder the right or privilege to mint a particular NFT at a later date. Think of it as a "ticket" or "voucher" that reserves your spot to claim another NFT once it becomes available. Here are the key features of mintpasses:

1. **Exclusive Access**: Mintpasses often provide early or exclusive access to a new NFT collection. They can be distributed to a select group of people, such as early supporters of a project.

2. **Guaranteed Opportunity**: Holding a mintpass typically guarantees you the opportunity to mint a new NFT without the rush and competition that can happen when a popular NFT collection is released to the public.

{Reactions}
👍 

[11/01/2023 08:22] 6529
3. **Price Advantage**: Sometimes, mintpasses allow holders to mint the subsequent NFT at a predetermined price, which could be advantageous if the demand for the NFT increases its value significantly by the time of public sale.

4. **Secondary Market**: Mintpasses can be traded or sold on secondary markets, and their value can fluctuate based on the perceived value of the NFT they allow you to mint.

5. **Fundraising Tool**: Projects may sell mintpasses as a way to raise funds before the actual NFTs are ready to be minted, providing capital for development and gauging the community's interest.

### How Do Mintpasses Work?

- **Pre-Mint**: The project team creates mintpasses and sells or distributes them before the main NFT collection is ready.
- **Claim Period**: Once the NFT collection is ready, mintpass holders can "redeem" their passes to mint the NFTs.
- **Post-Claim**: After the claim period, the mintpasses may expire, or they might have additional benefits or utilities as determined by the project creators.

### Benefits

- **For Creators**: They can secure funding and interest ahead of a full launch and build a community of dedicated supporters.
- **For Collectors**: They get assured access to NFTs, potentially at a lower cost, and can benefit from any appreciation in the value of either the mintpass or the NFT itself.

### Risks

- **Market Volatility**: The value of mintpasses and the subsequent NFTs can be highly volatile.
- **Project Failure**: If the project does not follow through or is delayed, the mintpass may lose value or become worthless.
- **Scams**: As with any crypto-related project, there is a risk of scams, so due diligence is essential.

Mintpasses add an extra layer to the NFT ecosystem, offering a novel way for creators and collectors to interact and for projects to manage the minting process. However, as with any investment, especially in the fast-moving world of NFTs, potential buyers should research thoroughly and proceed with caution.

Thanks


[11/01/2023 08:59] al_qa_qa
In minting processes,  there are two time periods available, `allowlistPeriods` and `publicPeriod` (This is not a variable name).

Can the two periods be set for the same minting? or for each minting process, it should have only one minting period.


[11/01/2023 09:16] __melonwater
They can both exist. Allowlist means at first only selected ppl can mint, public means later everyone can mint.

No just 1 nft can be minted from any user. Others need to wait 1 hour and then try to mint etc etc

Just a clarification for the sales model 3. If any tokens are not minted within the period they are moved to the next period ex. If the tine period is 10mins and noone mints then during the 2nd period a user can mint 2 tokens etc. this is how the sales model is designed to work. Thanks

[11/01/2023 14:52] piravlos
when you set the total supply for a collection indices for that collection are reserved, ex. for collection 1 and total supply 1000, the token indices from 10000000000 until 10000000999 are reserved for collection 1

[11/02/2023 04:57] stryder1496
as all of the functions are protected either by FunctionAdminRequired or CollectionAdminRequired


[11/02/2023 05:00] piravlos
Nftdelegation is a contract that was audited and is already used by the community.


[11/02/2023 05:01] piravlos
Auctions start then the mintToAuction function is called.


[11/02/2023 05:01] piravlos
The process of setting a collection ready for minting is a process that only admin can do and not normal users.


[11/02/2023 05:03] stryder1496
can you explain the process of how can a normal user create a collection then ?


[11/02/2023 05:05] piravlos
A normal user cannot create a collection. As you can clearly see from the code the functions for creating a collection ready for minting are called by admins. If you remove admin rights on that functions then a normal user can create collection but this is not the case here.

Also these 3 could be combined:
`tokensMintedAllowlistAddress`, `tokensMintedPerAddress`, `tokensAirdropPerAddress`


[11/02/2023 07:13] johnnytime
Also collections data is being split among mappings between both core and minter contracts, that's messy


[11/02/2023 07:14] johnnytime
Which makes these kind of things weird and dangerous
```solidity
require(
    block.timestamp >
        IMinterContract(minterContract).getEndTime(_collectionID) +
            collectionAdditionalData[_collectionID]
                .setFinalSupplyTimeAfterMint,
    "Time has not passed"
);
```


[11/02/2023 07:17] piravlos
things are a bit complex but why you mention that are dangerous ?


[11/02/2023 07:22] johnnytime
The current setup, where storage and data related to collections and tokens are distributed among numerous mappings across two contracts, presents a higher risk of errors. Improving the organization of data structures and storage would reduce the likelihood of making mistakes that could potentially result in security vulnerabilities. 
A better approach would be organizing all storage and information concerning collections and tokens into a single storage file and less mappings

this is why we want you to check if the current setup has issues 🙂

the collection admin can be a trusted member of the artists team. Rights to a collection admin will be given after the initial collection setup is finalized, this includes the createCollectiom, setData etc.


[11/02/2023 08:19] trachev
So collection admin rights are different from the function admin and the general admin, as they are not given to internal members of the protocol team, right?


[11/02/2023 08:24] piravlos
yes they will be given to artists trusted team members.

Relating to the part of delegating a user to make functions like mint, we assume its done correctly, since the NFTdelegation has been audited. But I want to understand what is actualy done, at least in this context, here is image that verifies the delegation. Please, could you illustrate the proccess @piravlos

[11/02/2023 09:41] piravlos
sure, if a delegator is provided during the allowlist phase, the code checks if a delegation exists between the msg.sender and the delegator on any collection (0x888888) for use cases 1 = all 2 = minting, if not then it checks for the same usecases on the delegationAddress provided set when you executed the setCollectionCosts function. If any o the above is true it allows the msg.sender to mint on behalf of a delegator otherwise it blocks him from minting.

CirculatingSupply refers to the current minted supply of a collection. 

CollectionTotalAmount refers to the funds received during minting.

gm, on the `burnOrSwapExternalToMint()` is used to burn or swap a token of an external existing collection to mint the new token, it's exact? The `burnOrSwapAddress` is proposed by the artist and validated by the admin ?


[11/02/2023 18:15] glcanvas
hello, what is `scripttext`?


[11/02/2023 18:26] piravlos
Yes burn from an external collection and mint a new token on a nextgen collection. Burn or swap will be decided by artist and team. Perhaps an external erc721 collection can be just mint passes and then when you burn your mintpass to get a token on nextgen.

[11/02/2023 18:55] piravlos
Guys a clarification on two points as I receive questions everyday for this:

1. The meaning of freezing (locking) a collection has nothing to do with disabling the minting process. Freezing a collection means that you lock a collection’s data, info, script, tokens’ data, tokens hash, metadata view etc on chain for ever. This state cannot be reverted so a collection will be freezed only when a minting ends and when we are sure that everything its fine.

2. burning. When you burn a token the circulatingSupply shouldn’t be reduced. This is the correct logic. You can mint a token and burn it while the minting is still active but this does not mean that someone else will mint it again ex a collection has a total supply of 100, minting is active someone mints a token and then burns it, this does not mean that users will be able to mint 101 tokens. In such a case circulating supply will be 100 but the tokens that exist for that collection will be 99.

The collection admin can be malicious, right?

No its considered trusted role.


[11/02/2023 19:55] trachev
Why, as it is a user outside of the NextGen team they could have intent to exploit the protocol? Would there be any KYC process for them?

it depends on the case, for sales model 3 the rate is considered as %, for sales model 2 it's consider as wei

In AuctionDemo.sol:

If a user bids again, new bid is created, instead of increasing the already existing one. Why?


[11/03/2023 07:56] piravlos
we store each bid separately, in order to bid your bid needs to be higher than the current higher bid.


[11/03/2023 07:57] aslanbekaibimov
I mean, why did you choose to create new bid instead of adding it to the user's previous bid?


[11/03/2023 08:00] piravlos

What exactly is `status` in `collectionSecondaryAddresses`?


[11/03/2023 08:51] piravlos
are the addresses that will be be used to send the royalties from secondary sales


[11/03/2023 08:53] yesofcourse_
Yes, I am asking about `bool status` in the struct


[11/03/2023 08:53] piravlos
artist proposes the primary/secondary addresses and then an admin should approve them


[11/03/2023 09:32] proxy1967
The artist is allowed to sign a collection when its frozen ?


[11/03/2023 09:34] piravlos
artists will need to sign the collection before even minting starts, this will be an agreement between team and artist


[11/03/2023 09:37] proxy1967
so every artist MUST sign the collection, they can't choose to sign or not ?


[11/03/2023 09:38] piravlos
no the purpose is to have the signatures of artists on-chain 🙂


[11/03/2023 09:39] proxy1967
right so they have to sign it in order for minting to proceed

@piravlos  to which sales option does Burn-to-Mint refer? is it 6? I want to test setCollectionCosts and I need to input uint8 _salesOption but want to test it for BurnToMint


[11/03/2023 12:55] piravlos
burn2mint does not have a different sales model

What you need to do is to:

Initiliaze burn2mint
setCollectionCosts for the collection that will generate the new tokens, the sales models can be 1-fixed 2-exponential/linear decay 3-periodic sale


[11/03/2023 13:48] fulum
Functions `proposePrimaryAddressesAndPercentages` and `proposeSecondaryAddressesAndPercentages` are intended to be used/set by the artist and approved only by the admin with `acceptAddressesAndPercentages`?

[11/03/2023 14:09] zdravkohr
It is called after the whole minting process has finished to set the totaSupply to the circulating assets


[11/03/2023 14:12] delvir0
Yes so it’s just to see what the ending total supply is, that number not used for anything else when the minting process has finished?


[11/03/2023 14:14] zdravkohr
Since the total supply has been set to be equal to the circulation amount, any subsequent trials to mint will fail because of the if checks whether the total amount is greater than the circulation +1

@piravlos can you talk more about “reservedmaxtokensIndex”


[11/04/2023 14:16] piravlos
This is from our docs

Each collection has its own custom token id based on the ID of the collection. 
For example: the collection with ID #1 reserves the token ids starting at 10000000000 while collection with ID #2 reserves the token ids starting at 20000000000 and so on.
This allows for easier display and segregation of collections on websites.

Now regards to max when you call setCollectionData you specify the collection supply if you set collection supply for collection 1 to 1000 the reservedmaxtokensindex will be 10000000999. So token indexes for collection 1 are reserved between 10000000000 - 10000000999. Collection supply cannot be modified after it was set. It can only be reduced in case of unminted collections after the end of minting.

what is the motivation behind the function mintAndAuction being allowed only for a global or function admin?


[11/06/2023 08:51] al_qa_qa
When listing an NFT in an auction, it first got minted to a trusted account owned by protocol devs. When the auction ends, the owner (which is devs) will transfer the NFT to the winner, and claim ETH.

Then devs will transfer ETH to NFT artist, but the mechanism of sharing profits is not smart contract based, and it's out of the scope.

[11/07/2023 02:54] audityourcontracts
Ser go to here -> https://code4rena.com/contests/2023-10-nextgen#top and then click on "Make a Submission" then "Submit Finding"


[11/07/2023 02:56] tamayonft
yeah but i had a private repot i dont know, if its better just copy and page the code of the set up and my POC in the finding or share the repo


[11/07/2023 02:56] audityourcontracts
You write a submission in mark down and include your finding in the submission. You can check past reports for how to include PoC etc.

fren as we have reached the max contract size (with 200 optimizations) we needed to combine some functions into one.

if index = 1000 then the function it will change the parameters shown into that block
if its index = 999 it will change just the baseURI

and to change just an index of the script array you can place the index of it ex. 0,1,2,3 etc

Soo do I get this right, all admin roles are completely trusted ( global admin, function admin and collection admin) and basically all issues related to them not providing valid function inputs or global / function admins having the power to basically change data on any collection they want to  are not valid findings because they are trusted? Because theres multiple cases of functions missing some checks and also multiple cases where I ( and others) feel like global and function admins have too much power

By trusted in my understanding It exclude possible malicious actions between trusted actors or to users but nothing more


[11/08/2023 17:43] tx.origin
So if I say finding A is an issue because a malicious function admin could do X its not valid 

But if I say finding A is an issue because a function admin could accidentally use wrong inputs and do something he shouldnt do it is valid

I'm relatively new to this as well and I don't get what I should submit and what not here lol


[11/08/2023 17:47] .akira0327
I don't think Trusted party will do malicious action as well as making wrong input. 🤣 
If this is not, this protocol should have a flood of issues and auditors should write their report till the end time.


[11/08/2023 17:50] tx.origin
Yeah i get that view as well but idk i dont like this approach. 
We are auditing the codebase after all and cant assume trusted roles to always make the right decisions and if stuff can happen that shouldnt happen based on the code it should be an issue.

But what do I know my name is still yellow lol 

I guess we will see some interesting advanced analysis reports at least


[11/08/2023 17:57] ericwillworkforcryptopunks
Yeah it seems then that there are only a couple of functions that can be exploited like mint() and burn(). If we just have to trust all admins to never get greedy or make a mistake then this is a tough codebase to audit.

What are "trusted roles" exactly


[11/08/2023 19:44] ustas.eth
C4 has a reputation to maintain. In a case like this, where the admins have most of the functionality of the system, it's strange to leave out most of the bugs untouched


[11/08/2023 19:55] al_qa_qa
Trusted rules are simply protocol devs in most cases.

Most of the protocols add some function to be available for them only. For example, pause function that pauses all the protocol in case there is a bug.

**How auditing deal withit**
If the protocol implements trusting roles that fire function that can control or crash the protocol, It is submitted as a medium issue under a name `Central Privilege risk`.

But, C4 bots catch this in most or 100% of situations, so you can't submit it :).


[11/08/2023 20:03] ustas.eth
Central privilege risks don't include unintended behavior of the admin functions. By my logic, they're only about malicious actions of admins, which is a pretty narrow scope of what can be done with admin rights.


[11/08/2023 20:03] ustas.eth
That's why we need more official explanations on the topic


[11/08/2023 20:10] catscanaudit
Yeah I think that when they say a role is "Trusted" 95% of the stuff including malicious/unintended related to the trusted role is invalid


[11/08/2023 21:17] al_qa_qa
Centralized privilege is the same as admin, as you are restricting the function to only a few people.

I don't know exactly, the point you are refering  to, but I will give an example according to what I understood.

Some admins can make critical changes to the protocol, this is right. The most dangerous one is by calling `updateAdmin` function, they will rewrite all roles to new roles, which will lead to the lose of control to the overall protocol, if its submitted wrongly.

Are this is the point you are refering to?


[11/08/2023 21:55] ustas.eth
`updateAdmin` has a clear functionality, and there's nothing wrong with it. I refer to problems that can arise from unconscious actions of trusted roles. For example, if `updateAdmin` with certain wrong params, it can transfer all the funds from the contracts to the zero address. Should we trust admins in such a case? Or should we point that out in a report so the problem will be fixed and there will be nothing to worry about? Adding all these issues to QA is not an answer because it discourages wardens from finding them.

@piravlos  hey, I've DMed you, could you please take a look at private messages?


[11/09/2023 01:23] piravlos
Guys i really dont know why some of you started this discussion. I had hundreds of discussions about reentrancy issues and other improvements of the contract and i agree on most of them. If any admin which we already mentioned is a trusted party inserts a wrong parameter into a function do you  consider it a bug? Honestly I think is not a bug. As we already mentioned trusted admins will be trusted gnosis safe wallets with 2/3 or 3/4 signatures so they will check if something is wrong or not. The main purpose of Nextgen is to create generative collections and then freeze them. Once you freeze a collection noone even the admins can’t revert the state. In 99% of erc721 contracts admins can revert the baseuri but I don’t see anyone talk about this. Anyone can take the protocol and redeploy without any trusted roles and then you can realize the main consequences of this as they might be duplicate collections and multiple errors. In any case in our case trusted roles are consider fully trusted addresses but if you think that you want to report anything on this feel free to report it.

[11/09/2023 01:25] piravlos

It's not important whether this protocol is decentralized or not, but what we are just discussing is that trusted roles' mistakes will be in auditing scope or not.
If this is true, auditors need to write reports all day long. 🤣

No problem fren 🙂


[11/09/2023 08:42] piravlos
Sorry i missed your question, the whole script will be onchain. One of the reason that we use an array for storing the script is to host large scripts. Anyone can call the retrieveGenerativeScript and get the script and this ehat will be used to generate the actual art. Also once you switch the metadata view for a collection the contract will create an onchain json object to generate the metadata and will not use off-chain metadata.

@piravlos - `burnToMint` function is for collections with maxPurchase set to 0 so that users can't mint without burning their previous collection items?


[11/09/2023 13:02] piravlos
yes 🙂


[11/09/2023 13:04] al_qa_qa
Yes, the devs initialize `burnToMint`, to make the minting process disallowed.

For example:
- Collection creators supply 1000 tokens to mint.
- Creators will make another 1000 tokens.
- Creators will disable minting and only allow people who have tokens to mint tokens from the new tokens [1001,2000] through `burnToMint` function after they initialize burning.

This is common in the NFT space, where the first NFTs to mint may be valuable, and the creator may need just to distribute the first NFTs to the old owners.

I think the tests are written by the devs, but they didn't include it in the code base.

They did a pretty thing, they made the test file that is included in the context define all the contracts and functions, to make it easy for auditors to write tests related to any function, after their definition.

So that auditors will not get lost in tons of lines of unit test code, I really liked this.

Mate contract has many setter functions and only trusted roles can call those functions


[11/09/2023 19:25] debofx
So, if I can set them, I have found bugs or it depends?


[11/09/2023 19:31] piravlos
Set them without being an admin? If yes then its a bug but i dont think so 🙂

Can artist or collections set a max on how many tokens a user can mint in total?? 

I see this in the collection data but this only pertains to the public mint "  * @param _maxCollectionPurchases Refers to the collection's max purchases/mints per address during public minting."


[11/10/2023 05:40] 0xarav
Sometimes the c4 website goes unresponsive. 
Try reloading


[11/10/2023 05:40] piravlos
gm, total mints are separated into allowlist spots and _maxCollectionPurchases. _maxCollectionPurchases  are set on the contract while allowlist spots are used for the generation of the merkle proofs and are inserted as input parameter while calling the mint() function.

`collectionEndMintCost` in the `Minter` contract is used to determine the price of the last token of the collection? Is that correct?

Anybody tried tweaking the contract(s) to test a POC? Anytime I change a line in a contract and run `npx hardhat test` I get an error like so:
`Error: Transaction reverted: trying to deploy a contract whose code is too large`
And this includes when I remove code making the contract actually smaller.

Any ides on how to bypass?


[11/10/2023 18:12] al_qa_qa
add this in `hardhat.config.js` file.

```
networks: {
    hardhat: {
        allowUnlimitedContractSize: true,
    },
},
```


[11/10/2023 18:12] asui0944
what does ``dmc.retrieveGlobalStatusOfDelegation`` do


[11/10/2023 18:13] asui0944
the delegate management contract is not in scope but in what way is it going to be used ?


[11/10/2023 18:16] ericwillworkforcryptopunks
This did the trick. Thank you sir:chefskiss:

{Reactions}
👍 

[11/10/2023 18:17] al_qa_qa
The delegation contract allows people (not NFT owners) to use NFTs owned by other people.

But in order to do it, the owner should give the sender the authority for doing this, since he is using the owner NFT.

These lines are used for checking that the caller has authority over this owner's NFT, if the caller is not the owner of the NFT.

{Reactions}
👍 

[11/10/2023 18:20] asui0944
mint function also calls this 
does that mean the owner(to be) will have to approve(delegate) the sender first even before the token is minted?


[11/10/2023 18:24] al_qa_qa
Delegating is different from approving.

Minting is creating an NFT which is not existed, so you can't approve and NFT which is not existed yet.

delegating is done, when user_A wants to mint an NFT to user_B.

You may not understand this logic, but this is done in the airdrop sale, so collection creators will choose certin peaple to mint in the airdrop period. And for the protocol to check this through `dmc.retrieveGlobalStatusOfDelegation`

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[11/10/2023 19:08] lsaudit
What's the difference between `collectionCirculationSupply` and `collectionTotalSupply`? When each should be increased/decreased?


[11/10/2023 19:22] gumgumzum
I believe:

collectionCirculationSupply is the number of NFTs that were minted so far.

collectionTotalSupply is the maximum number of NFTs that can be minted for that collection.


[11/10/2023 19:31] lsaudit
Hmm, `collectionCirculationSupply` - number of NTFs that were minted, or number of NTFs which already exists? E.g. if I burn() NTF, should `collectionCirculationSupply` decrease?


[11/10/2023 19:37] gumgumzum
Yeah, the name is confusing, but I think that should be `number of NTFs that were minted` mainly because of the presence of the totalSupplyOfCollection view function.


[11/10/2023 19:38] lsaudit
ok, thank you! @piravlos  could you please confirm that?


[11/10/2023 19:44] al_qa_qa
You will find a function in `NextGenCore` called `totalSupplyOfCollection()`. It returns the `collectionCirculationSupply` - the burned amount of this collection.

Decreasing the `collectionCirculationSupply` will cause duplication error between new minted tokens and burned ones.

So devs choosed to just increase the NFTs as they are, and when viewing the totalSupply, they suptract the two values.

Hey, @piravlos ! Can a collection be both traded with `mint` function and available for minting in exchange for burning another collection with `burnToMint`?


[11/11/2023 10:27] noahfig.eth
is salesOption = 3 a Periodic sale  ?


[11/11/2023 10:30] 0xbtk
yes


[11/11/2023 11:26] piravlos
yes but the process is that we first mint the collection and then we can burntomint on an another collection after X period passes. As you describe it its better to do only the minting of the second collection 🙂

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[11/11/2023 13:34] asui0944
users still has to pay eth to call burnTomint but doesn't get back eth for the previous token(the token to burn) right?


[11/11/2023 13:35] asui0944
And why would the users even use this function?


[11/11/2023 13:35] zdravkohr
This is a mintpass


[11/11/2023 13:35] zdravkohr
You get an NFT which you can later burn to obtain the real NFT


[11/11/2023 13:38] asui0944
but users still has to pay for the first token isn't or ?

@piravlos  can I DM?


[11/11/2023 13:46] 0xbtk
mint cost is optional. In 99% of these cases the cost will be set to 0 so users will burn and mint but the protocol can support the other 1% where users can burn + pay a fee and mint.

[11/13/2023 23:22] manchasss.eth
In the vast and treacherous realm of trust, one must navigate the turbulent waters of deception and broken promises. Trust, a concept as elusive as a cat on a hot tin roof, dances on the edge of reason, inviting us to plunge headlong into the abyss of vulnerability. Trust no one, they say. Trust everyone, they contradict. It's a paradoxical ballet of skepticism and naivety, leaving us mere mortals pondering the existential question: What does trust even mean?

Picture this: a world where trust is as rare as a unicorn sighting. You extend your hand in friendship, only to have it bitten by the fangs of betrayal. Trusting someone is like playing a high-stakes game of poker with a deck stacked against you – the joker being the one you chose to trust. Yet, in this grand Shakespearean tragedy of trust, there is a paradoxical twist. They tell you not to trust anyone, but then insist that trust is the foundation of any meaningful relationship. It's as confusing as deciphering hieroglyphics in the dark.

So, what does trust mean in this cacophony of contradictions? Is it a fragile glass sculpture destined to shatter with the slightest breeze, or a sturdy bridge leading to the promised land of genuine connections? The answer, my dear reader, lies somewhere between the realms of skepticism and blind faith, wrapped in a cloak of uncertainty. Trust, it seems, is a cryptic riddle with no definitive solution, leaving us to navigate this theatrical stage of life with a healthy dose of skepticism and a pinch of optimism...

how does the escalation process work in c4?


[12/09/2023 11:28] 0xsl1
you have to have a backstage role in order to be able to escalate


[12/09/2023 11:29] fedebianu

how to get backstage role?

check out the c4 docs for the exact requirements

You have backstage, shouldn’t you know more than us? 😂🤣


[12/11/2023 17:07] dimulski
Why do you think my question is directed to you? 😄 PJQA is over, some guys still trying to escalate slowing down the process


[12/11/2023 17:19] olanre_waju
Is it possible to escalate after PJQA?


[12/11/2023 17:29] 0xsl1
there are still some comments left that were posted before the end of PJQA, no one has tried to escalate after PJQA


[12/11/2023 17:35] dimulski
Usually not


[12/11/2023 17:38] ustas.eth
You can make a request to set up a Supreme Court Committee of 3 judges for a deposit of 500 USD 🙂


[12/11/2023 17:38] dimulski
is it up for the next gen contest


[12/11/2023 17:39] dimulski
don't think they collected the 3k required deposit


[12/11/2023 17:39] ustas.eth
Though I'm not sure whether it is part of the PJQA or not


[12/11/2023 17:40] ustas.eth
Do you want to try to?


[12/11/2023 17:40] dimulski
nope, I see one issue that the guys keep disagreening with the judge


[12/11/2023 17:41] al_qa_qa
Guys sorry for interrupt, but what is PJQA proccess, and how it is going. can a warden defend his finding from getting canceled or downguarded at this time? And Is this true? `You can make a request to set up a Supreme Court Committee of 3 judges for a deposit of 500 USD`


[12/11/2023 17:41] dimulski
was just interested if it is up for this contest as I don't think the supreme court decisions was finalized when the contests started


[12/11/2023 17:41] ustas.eth
The process in only available for the backstage role


[12/11/2023 17:42] dimulski
the way I understand it, it is a faze after PJQA don't know how much time and in what duration


[12/11/2023 17:42] ustas.eth
I don't know the details, honestly, it was more of a joke, sorry if I confused you

{Reactions}
👌 

[12/11/2023 17:43] al_qa_qa
I know it is for backstagers, but I want to know how it is being done? can the warden provide more details and POCs to validate his finding at this time, or its related to QA issues only?


[12/11/2023 17:45] ustas.eth
Yes, you can provide your feedback to the judges with PoC and more explanations. If the judges decide that your arguments are sufficient, they will increase the severity


[12/11/2023 17:47] al_qa_qa
Interresting! thanks a lot ustas. Hope to get 1H or 3M in this context to open this rule, it seems interesting. and viewing reports after ending the context is good too.

[12/11/2023 17:52] 0xsorrynotsorry
One can only provide additional context / POC if the Judge requests during the PJQA, so it will require at least a backstage role.

The verdict is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y2wJVt0d2URv8Pptmo7JqNd0DuPk_qF9EPJAj3iSQiE/edit#heading=h.hu7fwaaicfqa)

```
POC submitted during post-judging QA or during judge period 

Has been addressed in a separate ruling.
See: Standardization of additional warden output during QA
```
👇 

```
Standardization of additional warden output during QA

No new information should be introduced and considered in PJQA. Elaborations of the already introduced information can be considered (e.g. tweaking a POC), from either the Judge or the Warden, but they will only count towards the validity of the issue, not its quality score.

usually a few days. Depends on the number of escalations I guess. Anyone with backstage role can please confirm if we should expect results soon?

[12/15/2023 14:30] _paperparachute
Also, if you aren't backstage, and awards aren't announced, how are you aware a finding has been rejected?

Are you sure that this is the logo from current audit and not the previous one (if there was any)?
And does it appear for everyone at the same time?


[12/15/2023 14:37] 0xsl1
you have to be certified to enable displaying logos on your profile


[12/15/2023 14:40] kimchi_the_dog
There were a lot of submissions, I wonder how many vulnerabilities there will be in the end.


[12/15/2023 14:46] _paperparachute
None of your findings for Dopex were "lost in the dark", each and every one was seen by both the lookout and the judge, and judged accordingly. The judges care about every valid issue submitted, and judge them all.


[12/15/2023 14:48] kimchi_the_dog
Yeah, kudus for judges and lookouts 🙌 
Sorting all of these is not an easy task


[12/15/2023 14:56] 0xlemon
I see NextGen logo on my profile does that mean that I have a valid issue or just that I submitted some issues?

hey, 
just found i'm in the leaderboard (around 190 dollars), but cannot find more info about my findings. On my profil, i can see the ''help secure" at the bottom, but i don't see details about my finding at the top, how can i know about my findings?

[12/15/2023 16:29] tadev0
for other contests, i can see my findings at the top on the right. If you're right, how people know right which findings of theirs were validated?

now i see it, thanks!


[12/15/2023 16:31] droptpackets.eth

You have to understand how messed up that is


[12/15/2023 16:32] tx.origin
@droptpackets my guy if 200 people find something of course the rewards are low
Check out c4 docs to see how rewards are calculated


[12/15/2023 16:32] kimchi_the_dog
@droptpackets It's not about working hard - it's about working smart and according to the rules that are what they are


[12/15/2023 16:33] tadev0
there might be a reason. there is always one 🙂


[12/15/2023 16:33] mrpotatomagic
depends contest to contest but nothing specific tbh, might wanna take a look at the C4 docs for what is expected


[12/15/2023 16:33] inzinko
@0xraion we can apply for backstage through the helpdesk right ?


[12/15/2023 16:33] tx.origin
yup


[12/15/2023 16:33] droptpackets.eth
Understood. I will learn from this. Frustrated, but will learn.


[12/15/2023 16:33] _paperparachute
See [here](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards) for further info about award calculation.


[12/15/2023 16:33] droptpackets.eth
I have read it thoroughly before


[12/15/2023 16:34] kimchi_the_dog
I looked and I have the impression that I gave sensible advice there. I don't know if it's about the number of these tips, the format or something else.

The docs are quite vague, and I don't see any feedback from previous contests about what was wrong.


[12/15/2023 16:35] _paperparachute
Well, the explanation is the math provided. Also, finding 4 highs basically immediately makes you elegible for backstage, if you've participated in 3+ audits. That alone is worth a lot.

[12/15/2023 16:35] oualidpro
Please how long does it takes to get the backstage role ?


[12/15/2023 16:36] neo_granicen
what does backstage make you able to do?


[12/15/2023 16:36] _paperparachute
Like MrPotatoMagic said, it ranges hugely from audit to audit. Some high severity findings pay out thousands, others "peanuts" as you describe.


[12/15/2023 16:36] tadev0
inzinko i'm eligible to backstage now, where should i go to apply for it ?


[12/15/2023 16:36] _paperparachute
Once you've applied normally <24h


[12/15/2023 16:36] tx.origin
I have a question regarding the 3+ audits thing.
How does that get tracked if I dont submit anything on 2-3 contests and find my first high == my first submission at all afterwards


[12/15/2023 16:36] _paperparachute
create a [helpdesk](https://code4rena.com/help) query.


[12/15/2023 16:36] tadev0
thank you @PaperParachute | C4


[12/15/2023 16:38] _paperparachute
Sorry I don't understand your question here. You have to have participated in 3 audits, and have at least 1H or 3Ms, or some other criteria found [here](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/certified-contributors/backstage-wardens#to-request-+backstage-access)


[12/15/2023 16:38] neo_granicen
how long will it take for the findings to appear in my Past findings?


[12/15/2023 16:38] inzinko
i am also intrested, are these three audits where you got confirmed findings


[12/15/2023 16:38] tx.origin
I mean if I participated in 3 contests but didn't find anything before theres no proof I participated in 3 contests


[12/15/2023 16:39] _paperparachute
Well, you have to have submitted _something_ which staff can see.


[12/15/2023 16:40] _paperparachute
Analysing the codebase and not submitting anything wouldn't count as participating. I'd call that studying.


[12/15/2023 16:40] neo_granicen
how long will it take for the findings to appear in my Past findings?
@PaperParachute | C4


[12/15/2023 16:41] _paperparachute
Sorry, it normally updates in about an hour


[12/15/2023 16:43] mrpotatomagic
probably all of that, you should check past reports on the C4 site to see how you could make them better


[12/15/2023 16:45] tadev0
@PaperParachute | C4  i made my backstage request  with ''warden registration", and i just received the mail for registration (for KYC). i guess i should have chosen ''others'', sorry for that


[12/15/2023 16:49] _paperparachute
Not seeing the request, can you resubmit please.

@PaperParachute | C4 Hi, Does the `backstage` role criteria consider only the valid issues found during solo audits, or does it also include valid issues identified as a team?

Not at my PC right now, I shared a helpdesk link above ^


[12/15/2023 17:50] young09778
Yes it’s the same thing for me. Very frustrating


[12/15/2023 17:50] itsmetechjay
While I can understand wanting to know your results sooner, backstage wardens need to keep the information about findings private until the repos are open.


[12/15/2023 17:51] 0x1118641
I submitted the query through the helpdesk, thank you @PaperParachute | C4


[12/15/2023 17:51] _paperparachute
Info about your findings won't be shared until report release


[12/15/2023 17:53] cryptothemex
If a finsing is selected to be included in report, whats the reward differenec with other dups?


[12/15/2023 17:54] 0x1118641
So does backstage allows you to see how judge dealt with your own submissions ?


[12/15/2023 17:54] 0xsmartcontractsamurai
I too was expecting at least one valid submission, but got nothing. If it's my mistake, I learn & improve.
If it's because I might not have submitted an analysis report... 💩 Didnt get to it unfortunately.

Learning & improving is good.
But I thought my bugs were good too...

sometimes it's released quickly but depends on when the staff gets the green light


[12/18/2023 20:40] stakog
I'm just wondering... If the contest (including judging and all) ended, prizes are sent and the protocol is not on mainnet yet, what prevents c4 from releasing the report?


[12/18/2023 20:49] mrpotatomagic
Maybe the C4 team can answer this better but it's mostly after sponsor has applied all mitigations and launched the codebase. It can be earlier as well if the sponsor wishes.

I'm wondering whether this had an impact on the highs being devalued so much, or it's just $COPE on my part.  "Hundreds of discussions about reentrancy" was a pretty good indicator there was re-entrancy 😉 https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1166760088963383336/1171983418238705737
